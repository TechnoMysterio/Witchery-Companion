## Traits / Modifiers:
### Brew Affinity 
[On Armor (Helmet and Chest only)]
Increases brew yield for Kettle. Equals to firstBonus of kettle (mimics witch's robes)

### Witch's Veil
[On Armor]
Armor piece becomes invisible when entity wearing it is invisible (mimics witch's robes)

### Goblins' Favor: 
[On Armor]
When retrieving worship power to check for symbol effect spell, it will be cast as if the player has 1 more worshippers per held piece (so up to five if player is wearing full set + pickaxe in offhand, with mystic branch in main hand). Does not increase the chance of having Mog and Gulg coming to you. Number of actual worshipped is considered there instead

### Fireblooded

Provides some benefits to vampires the more pieces are worn. Incompatible with other Resistance modifiers and traits on armor pieces.
2 Pieces: Increased blood-drinking speed; 3 Pieces: Basic flame protection and Mesmerize duration boost; 4 Pieces: Enhanced flame protection

### Nullified

Provides several benefits to the creature wearing the armor:
- 25% chance of mitigating general magic damage
- 25% chance of mitigating the effects of voodoo poppet
- 90% chance of mitigating the Curse of Waking Nightmare
- 90% chance of resisting to being summoned by the Rite of Transposition
- 100% chance of mitigating the effects of Vampiric Poppet
- Protection Poppets won't work
- Enables the player to unleash the effects of Nullifying Bolts or Arrows/Bolts with the Nullified Modifier/Trait

[On Weapons]
More damage to vampires, weapons and projectiles only
[On Armor]
Damage from vampires attacks are halved in damage. Vampire attackers will receive a small amount of Fire damage, and armor won't be damaged from those attacks. Incompatible with Silvered, Demonrend

### Wolfsbane [Wolfsbane, 64x for max level (1)]. Makes up for the existance of Fire aspect for Vampires, but might be too powerful, so this nerf is required
[On Weapons]
Deals significantly more damage to werewolf creatures, but at the expense of less damage to all others. Incompatible with Silvered

### Demonrend [Bone Needles, 12x to max level (1)]
[On Weapons] NEW
Deals 50% more damage to Undead and Demons

[On Armor (Helmet only)]
Decanting Bonus, helmets only. Equals to secondBonus of Kettle, so gives a chance for a third brew

### Bloodthirst [???]
[On Weapons (Swords only)]
Adds a blood reservoir. Sword-like weapons only. Upon kill, stores blood in it and vampires can drink from it (mimics Cane Sword). For implementation, take a look at Fluxed Trait from Tinkers Evolution. Should come from Woven Cruor

### Creeper Repellent [Creeper Heart]
[On Armor (Chest only)]
Creepers ignore you (mimics witch's robes). Only on chestplate, incompatible with Necromantic. Only applicable to Impregnated Leather material

### Necromantic [Necromantic Stone]

### Nostalgic [Ruby Slippers]

Allows the player to use the chant /chant there's no place like home. Player needs to be infused, and is teleported to their spawn point. Costs 40% infusion power if same dimension, 60% otherwise. Cooldown: 30 minutes. 
Allows the player to drop a bound waystone nearby and use the same chant to teleport to the waystone's location (waystone will be consumed). Costs 20% of infused power if same dimension, 40% otherwise. Saving having to draw a circle for the Rite of Transposition. Only on footwear, incompatible with Seeping. Only applicable to Impregnated Leather material

### Seeping [Seeping Shoes]
[On Armor (Boots only)]

### Nullifying [Nullifying Bolts]
[On Weapons (Bolts and Arrows only)]
Ignores Bark Belt and Baba Yaga's torns when doing damage. When shoot by a player that is wearing the full Nullified armor, on hit, the target is drained of 1/3 of their magical power (infusion power?) and Poppet-based protections won't work (Vampiric and Death). Also removes magical potion effects, except poison and wither. Shooter is drained of all their magical power, if they have any

### Barked [Bark Belt]
[On Armor]
Armor provides protection AND Bark Belt charges, that, as long as the attacking weapon is not made out of wood, will protect the wearer by consuming the belt charges instead of doing damage. Belt charges will recharge by simply standing on grass or mycelium (CraftTweaker support already added)



## Discarded Content:
### Icy Slippers
Have the Witch's Veil trait. Freezes water when walking on it, turning it to ice. Also turns lava into obsidian, albeit they receive damage and has a small chance to set the player on fire. Reason: uninteresting
