In the right hands its full potential can be unlocked, as it can display the world from other creatures' point of view or even see into the future. The Crystal Ball requires $(l:altar/altar)Altar Power$(/l) to function and only works for $(item)Fortune Tellers$(): players who crafted the Crystal Ball themselves."

As this is a divination, the user has no control over the creature. While divining, the user can still move, but much slower, as typically they are not in their own point of view. The divination works up to a distance of 150 blocks."
