It can be used as a quick way to escape back to a safe place, be it the last place where the player slept or the world's $(item)Spawn Point$(). $(br)The Chant requires the player to be $(l:kettle/infusion_intro)Infused$(/l) and will consume 40% of the Infusion Power, 60% if the Spawn Point is across dimensions."
