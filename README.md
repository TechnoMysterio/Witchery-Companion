# Witchery: Companion

A Companion to Witchery: Resurrected fixing bugs, crashes, patching things and adding integrations and
configurability. Witchery: Resurrected is a required dependency, and is the original 1.7.10 Witchery
jar in the resource packs folder.

## Current Features (as of v0.10-alpha):
### Bugfixes:
- **Common**

  - **[Altar]** Fix client crash when the player joins a world where Placed Items are within view in the first frame
  - **[Coffin]** Fix edge-case crash when placing the Coffin across chunk boundaries

### Tweaks
- **Brews**
  - **[Common]** Tweak to disable power ceiling. Fixes some 'non bugs' related to the impossibility of applying certain
    brews with power greater than one (healing, damage, etc)
  - **[Common]** Tweak to force all brews to still apply effect to blocks/entities even if the 'ignore' modifiers
    are applied. This is needed for example to make a Brew of Blast, with ignore blocks modifier, to make an explosion when
    hitting a block (but the explosion won't damage terrain). Each brew is then delegated to ignore the effects, depending
    on applied modifiers
  - **[Brew of Erosion]** Tweak to add CraftTweaker integration to what blockstates the brew can mine, destroy, etc
- **Entities**
  - **[Enchanted Broom]** Tweak Enchanted Broom max health
  - **[Lord of Torment]** Tweak to disable mid-fight teleportation to Torment dimension
  - **[Lord of Torment]** Tweak to disable hardcoded loot drops (enchanted books)
  - **[Owl]** Tweak to disable taking items (since flying AI is bugged and might dupe items)
  - **[Owl]** Tweak to change the model slightly when the owl is sitting
  - **[Owl]** Tweak to render children Owls smaller
- **Items**
  - **[Chalk]** Tweak Chalk max stack size to 1, to avoid weird item loss due to stacking problems
- **Rites**
  - **[Moving Earth]** Tweak to disable moving TileEntity (for dupes)
  - **[Moving Earth]** Tweak to disable voiding blocks above the ritual. This will make the ritual stop (fail) when
    there is not enough space above to move the terrain upwards
  - **[Moving Earth]** Tweak refund policy to modify the cases in which the ritual refunds the player
    - **0**: Never refound - even if the ritual fails to move terrain, even by 1 block, it won't refund the player
    - **1**: Refund if partial - if the ritual does not move the blocks all the way up, it will refund the player
    - **2**: Refund on fail - only refund the player when the ritual could not move any block
  - **[Moving Earth]** Tweak to configure a blacklist of blockstates that the ritual should not move
  - **[Moving Earth]** Tweak to configure indicators of failure (smoke paticles and sounds) will be generated near the
    unmovable block

### Integrations
- **Crafttweaker**
  - **[Altar]** Integration to register or un-register Blocks nearby the altar that can power the Altar
  - **[Witch's Cauldron]** Integration to register or un-register Blocks underneath the cauldron that can act as a heat
    source. Supports fluids
  - **[Brew of Erosion]** Integration to customize what the brew can mine, destroy or ignore, including
    a maximum harvest level

- **Just Enough Resources**
  - **[Entities]** Integration to register many entities and their loot in entity drops category

### Performance
- **Blocks**
  - **[Altar]** Implement caching for the Power Source map
  - **[JEI Integration]** Option to skip recipe syncing for user-made recipes to save world loading time

### Future Plans
- Add CraftTweaker integration for main recipe categories (Cauldron, Distillery, Kettle, Oven)
- Add CraftTweaker integration for Brew of Sprouting, to specify valid trees to spawn
- Finish JER Integration
- Squishing all bugs
- Tinkers Construct / Construct Armory integration (Armor traits or tools that can be used in place of Witchery ones)
- JEI Handlers for as many things as possible (Altar Power providers, Goblin trades, Baba Yaga drops, etc)

### Help Wanted
- Owl AI
- Winged Monkey AI
- Brew Bucket item
- Remove WitcheryLoadingPlugin and provide all missing models, textures and so on to remove dependency from OG Witchery JAR
- Groovyscript Integration
